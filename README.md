//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Info:
- Each face of the cube is labelled, the faces include: Up, Down, Left, Right, Front and Back
- The shuffle button in the top right of the application (middle icon of the three) will randomise the cubelet positions
- The reset button on the far right at the top of the application will reset the cube to a solved state
- To execute an algorithm from the dropdown menu, simply click on its row
- To setup the cube to the position where the algorithm should be used, click the 'Setup' button on its respective row
- If an algorithm 'Setup' is executed, the 'SOLVE' button at the bottom of the application will be enabled, allowing you to automatically execute the algorithm at a slow speed

How to play:

(keyboard and mouse)

1. To rotate a face 90 degrees clockwise, press the key that corresponds to the first letter of the face i.e. key 'f' = front face, key 'd' = down face etc.
2. To rotate a face counter-clockwise, hold shift and press the corresponding key e.g. 'shift + f'
3. To move two faces at once (double-face move), use a face key whilst holding 'control' e.g. 'ctrl + f'. This will rotate the front face and the layer underneath it (if you were looking down at the face). You can combine these with 'shift' to execute an inverse double-face move
4. To rotate the 3 available middle layers, use keys: 'm', 'e' and 's'. Combining these with 'shift' will rotate them the opposite direction also
5. To move the camera, click and drag across the screen



(touch-screen)

1. To rotate a face clockwise, tap as close as possible to its label e.g. rotate the front face by tapping the 'FRONT' label
2. To rotate a face counter-clockwise, double-tap the label
3. To change the camera's position, touch and drag across the screen
